# Lineup Data
An app to organize and display lineup data for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, live [here](https://awbridgers.github.io/lineup-data/).

## How to Use
* The default displays the total season lineup data sorted by net +/-.
* View individual player data by clicking **View Players**.
  * Note: This is the *team data* while a certain player is on the floor, not the player's individual stats.
* Choose between season totals, conference totals, or individual games using the dropdown bar.
* Sort lineups by category by clicking on the column header, select the same header to reverse the sort.
* There are 2 types of data that can be viewed by clicking **Advanced** or **Overview** button in the top right.
   * Overview: basic statistics such as time, net +/-, reb +/-, shooting percentages, etc.
   * Advanced: Per 100 possession stats such as ORtg, DRtg, Reb%, etc.
* Use the **Lineup Finder** to search for individual lineups
  * Select up to 5 players to include in the results
  * Select up to 5 players to omit from the results, and select the style of omitting players
    * AND: Only omit lineups that include *ALL* of the players in the omit section. Omitting X *and* Y will include lineups with X and lineups with Y, but not both.
    * OR: Omit lineups that include *ANY* of the players in the omit section. Omitting X *or* Y will omit any lineup that has X, any lineup that has Y, and any lineups with both X and Y.
  * Select *All Lineups* in red in the top right to exit the lineup finder data.
* View the abbreviations and formulas for stat calculations using the **Glossary**.
